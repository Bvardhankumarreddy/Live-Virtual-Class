    <p class="text1" >Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form,
      harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. Exact definitions of music
      vary considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a 
      cultural universal. While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements,
      there is no consensus on their precise definitions. The creation of music is commonly 
      divided into musical composition, musical improvisation, and musical performance, though 
      the topic itself extends into academic disciplines, criticism, philosophy, and psychology. 
      Music may be performed or improvised using a vast range of instruments, including the human 
      voice.In some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised.
      For instance, in Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following
      a partially defined structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers 
      may take turns leading and responding, while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz
      context, there may be no structure whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion.

    </div>

      <p class="text2" >Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement with 
        aesthetic and often symbolic value, either improvised or purposefully selected.
        Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements,
        or by its historical period or place of origin.An important distinction is to be drawn 
        between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two 
        categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether 
        social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. Other forms of 
        human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, 
        gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many 
        other forms of athletics. Dance is not solely restricted to performance, though, as dance 
        is used as a form of exercise and occasionally training for other sports and activities. 
        Dance itself has also become a sport for some, with dancing competitions found across the 
        world exhibiting various different styles and standards.Dance requires an equal amount of
        cognitive focus as well as physical strength. The demanding yet evolving art-form allows 
        individuals to express themselves creatively through movement, while enabling them to adapt
         movement that possesses a rhythmical pattern and fluid motions that allure to an audience 
         either onstage or on film.

      <p class="text3" >Extracurricular activities are programs that:
        Are not part of the regular school curriculum; and, 
        Are structured around an activity, goal, or purpose
        Also known as extra-academic activities, extracurricular activities include sports, 
        student government, community service, employment, arts, hobbies, and educational clubs. 
        Extracurricular activities all complement an academic curriculum. While these activities 
        can be structured by age group, such as high school programs, they aren’t always.
        For example, your teen might volunteer with a local charity or have a part-time job.
        Participating in high school extracurricular activities is a great way to widen your 
        teen’s social circle, expand their interests, and build leadership skills. Studies show 
        that involvement in high school extracurricular activities leads to positive long-term 
        outcomes. Colleges look for applicants who are motivated outside of the classroom. 
        Admission officers seek passionate students who demonstrate leadership and pursue interests
         beyond their schoolwork. They know that teens engaged in their high schools and 
         communities are more likely to behave similarly in college.

      <p class="text4" >Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game
         that aims to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing 
         enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. Sports can, 
         through casual or organized participation, improve participants' physical health. 
         Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with 
         hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. 
         In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or 
         consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, 
         each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there 
         is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and 
         one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
         Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season,
         followed in some cases by playoffs.
