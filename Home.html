      An online school (virtual school or e-school or cyber-school) teaches students entirely or
      primarily online or through the Internet. It has been defined as "education that uses one or 
      more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and 
      to support regular and substantive interaction between the students. Online education 
      exists all around the world and is used for all levels of education . This type of learning enables 
      the individuals to earn transferable credits, take recognized examinations, and advance to the next level of education
      over the Internet.Virtual education is most commonly used in high school and college.
      30-year-old students or older tend to study online programs at higher rates.Virtual education is becoming
      increasingly used worldwide. There are currently more than 4,700 colleges and universities
      that provide online courses to their students. In 2015, more than 6 million students 
      were taking at least one course online, this number grew by 3.9% from the previous year. 
      29.7% of all higher education students are taking at least one distance course. The total 
      number of students studying on a campus exclusively dropped by 931,317 people between the 
      years 2012 and 2015.Experts say that because the number of students studying at the 
      college level is growing, there will also be an increase in the number of students enrolled 
      in distance learning.</p>

      focused in order to be successful in virtual learning. Just like being at an actual school, 
      these pre-teens and teenagers have to make sure they are presentable/looking good before 
      logging onto their classes and have to greet all of their friends and turn off their
      cellphones before the lesson begins because that will be a big distraction for them just as
     it would in the classroom. Some of the same problems that exist at school have the potential 
     of existing at home with virtual school.</p>

      Virtual classrooms are made possible through the use of educational technology with the 
      help of the internet. The internet itself can be credited on what enabled modern distance 
      learning to be developed. The internet plays a role in virtual classrooms with resources 
      such as virtual test taking functions, systems that aide coursework that include electronic 
      reading materials, video conferencing for lectures and chatrooms. During the COVID-19 
      pandemic, the United States began to encourage social distancing in the education system.
      One use of technology that was found to be resourceful in the collaboration of students 
      and teachers in virtual learning was the use of video conferencing.[6] The utilization
    of web video conferencing allows students to communicate virtually with their teachers and 
    simulate a classroom environment, with many using services such as Zoom and Cisco WebEx.
    To engage virtual students even further, a process known as gamification can be used to teach 
    a student learning material in a form of a game to bring more enjoyment in a student's 
    learning experience. Secondlife, an online virtual world, is a type of gamification system 
    that is used for online educational purposes. Secondlife can be used as a substitute for 
    face to face learning. It has qualities that resembles an in person curriculum such as class
     discussions, participation in lectures, and completing assignments. Gamification can also 
     serve as an aide to increase a student's intrinsic motivation. The use of rewarding points
     while a student is using a gamification system can enhance internal motivation and motivate 
     the student to accomplish learning goals from the game's objective. During the COVID-19 
     pandemic, many schools turned to virtual learning.
